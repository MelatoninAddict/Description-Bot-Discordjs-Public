      text: "Staking rewards (in RBW) are distributed to sRBW holders daily. The longer you stake your RBW, the bigger your daily staking rewards will be.
            \n\n
            üìà **General Formula** üìà\n
            sRBW = RBW x multiplier based on timelock\n
            Daily Reward % = sRBW/(total sRBW staked)\n
            \n
            üßÆ **Sample Calculations** üßÆ\n
            \n
            A. Staking 100 RBW for 1 month; Assume only 1000 total sRBW (including yours)\n
            Get sRBW equivalent: 100 x 1.25 (1-month multiplier) = 125 sRBW\n
            Get Daily Reward %: (125/1000) * 100 = 12.5%\n
            \n
            B. Staking 100 RBW for 1 year; Assume only 1000 total sRBW including yours)\n
            Get sRBW equivalent: 100 x 4 (1 year multiplier) = 400\n
            Get Daily Reward %: (400/1000) * 100 = 40%\n
            \n
            **Daily rewards can be claimed every day, but have a vesting period of 7 days after claiming.**\n
            \nThis means any staking rewards will not be received immediately upon claiming, but after 7 days. This vesting period protects the value of RBW from being manipulated by bad actors. RBW rewards can be used in-game, traded, or staked again."

            The RBW staking leaderboard can be found here:
            üîó https://cryptounicorns.vault.inc/#/leaderboard
            \n
            The leaderboard is a ranking system that awards additional points to based on the following formula:\n
            \n
            üßÆ **sRBW token amount * days that it HAS been staked so far = Current Points**\n
            \n
            For example, if you stake 1000 RBW for 12 months, you would receive 4000 sRBW * 1 day = 4,000 points every day. On day 4, you would have 16,000 points.\n
            \n
            To determine the full amount of points you would get from staked RBW (in this example, the full amount you would get after 12 months of staking):\n
            \n
            üßÆ **sRBW token amount * days it WILL be staked = Total Points over 12 months**\n
            \n
            So at the end of the year, you would have 4000 sRWB * 360 days = 1,440,000 points from the 1000 RBW that you staked.\n
            \n
