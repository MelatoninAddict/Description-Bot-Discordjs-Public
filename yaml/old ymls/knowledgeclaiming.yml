      text: "For Long-term Unicorn & Land Holders\n
            \n
            A snapshot was taken at March 4, 2022 00:00 UTC that calculated how long each wallet had held each Unicorn and Land. Players were rewarded the following points for each full-day that the wallet held a Unicorn or Land NFT.\n
            \n
            **Point Values**\n
            ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Unicorn = 1\n
            ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Common Land = 1\n
            ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Rare Land = 1.25\n
            ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Mythic Land = 1.75\n
            \n
            After much feedback from the community members that owned land, we've decided to award more points for land due to there being a lower amount of possible ‚Äúretention‚Äù days and to provide extra retention value for land holders since they were unable to participate in the Dark Forest.\n
            \n
            üßÆ **Sample Calculation**üßÆ\n
            \n
            üÖ∞Ô∏è **UNICORN #1102 was owned by Wallet 1 for 30 days and Wallet 2 for 5 days.**\n
            - Wallet 1 received 30 points for the time they owned UNICORN #1102\n
            - Wallet 2 received 5 points for the time they owned UNICORN #1102.\n
            \n
            üÖ±Ô∏è **Wallet 1 owned a Mythic Land for 25 days and a UNICORN for 45 days.**\n
            -Wallet 1 will receive 43.75 points for holding the Mythic Land and 45 points for holding the UNICORN.\n
            -Wallet 1 will have a total retention point amount of 88.75\n"

            After calculating the total amount of retention points per wallet, we created 21 tiers and assigned an RBW value for each tier.\n
            \n
            Each wallet, with over 1 day retention for either Unicorns or Land, received a tier based on how they ranked against their peers. This means that if a wallet held a UNICORN or LAND for at least 1 day, they will receive 100 RBW. Any wallet holding less than 1 day was excluded.\n
            \n
            Please note that there is no solid min-max per tier as the ranks are based on the total number of retention points. If other players have more retention points than you, then you will rank lower in comparison.\n"
