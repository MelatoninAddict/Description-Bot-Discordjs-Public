            \n
            \nLootboxes are NFTs that, when opened in-game, grant users starter items such as berries, seeds, crafting materials, and possibly even UNIM and RBW. This item is tradeable and comes in three different rarities.
            \n
            \n
            \n:question: Want to know more about Lootboxes? Check out this Medium article about Lootboxes here:
            \n
            \n:link: https://medium.com/@lagunagames/lootboxes-179a864a8f8e
            \n
            \n
            \n:exclamation: Important: Before you can open a Lootbox, you must first claim it. Keep in mind that once a Lootbox is “claimed,” it is permanently in-game and cannot be sent back to the Wallet.
            \n
            \nClick on the *Steps* button below to go through the lootbox guide."
